The workshop held in April 2021 generated the content and topics for this manuscript collection. The workshop had two key parts: 1) defining questions for the WHONDRS dataset (global OM chemistry dataset from river corridors) in terms of the core and satellite concept from ecological theory to ultimately produce a single crowdsourced manuscript and 2) gathering feedback on how to effectively crowdsource. 
 
For #1 we had participants define a key question surrounding the core and satellite concept using this dataset, discuss what analyses they would use to answer, and then sketch their prediction in graph form. After the workshop, we realized that there were enough questions around this dataset in the vein of ecology that we could have more than one manuscript.
 
For #2, we had participants answer questions and discuss effective crowdsourcing strategies such as how to diversify participation, ensure all voices are heard, keep people engaged, and track progress. Clear outcomes from these questions were to break people into writing teams, identify leaders, establish clear deadlines, and maintain flexibility with meeting schedules.

Particpants discussed #1 and #2 and recorded thoughts in jamboards (content included in files below). Other files, including slides from the workshop, are included in this GitHUb Repo:
